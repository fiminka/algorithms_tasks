## Description

This repository consists of two tasks incuding projects from courses "Programowanie" (2nd semester) and "Algorytmy" (3rd semester) at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

### Algorithms tasks
Creating classes implementing binary trees and heaps that work with mathematics problems, like derivatives, and sort variables.

### Currency converter

- from_list
- len_vec
- elem_sum
- scalar_prod
And operators:
- add
- sub
- mul and rmul
- repr
- len
